    <h1>Joseph M. Sak</h1>

    <h2>A software craftsman in Montréal with proficiency in <a href="http://www.tryruby.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://html5.org/">HTML5</a>, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, and <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>. Here is <a href="/cv.pdf">my c.v.</a></h2>

    <p>Salut! I'm Joe, a U.S. citizen living in Montréal, and I’m a programmer. I’ve loved computers since I was eight years old, and began tinkering with code as early as age twelve, when I wrote QBasic scripts to play songs. I've spent a lot of my time since then making web sites, working on side projects and ideas, and working in the industry professionally since I was in college. I am relatively active on <a href="https://github.com/joemsak">GitHub</a>, making contributions whenever I can identify and fix bugs, or add features in the libraries that I use.</p>

    <p>For the past two years, I have been developing my personal process that is test-driven, craft-focused, and highly disciplined. I obsess over the design of modules and systems, and I check and double-check the cleanliness and readability of my code. I follow the red-green-refactor method during testing, and yes, I even refactor my tests. I'm extremely attentive to detail and I work meticulously and thoughtfully. I spend a considerable amount of up-front time learning about a problem or system before putting my fingers to the keys, while maintaining productivity and staying on schedule. I am committed to delivering high quality softwarer. I have high demands of myself and my work, and the projects that I sign off on.</p>

    <p>I always aim to create outstanding products and value for my clients. At the end of the day, I care deeply about how the customer feels when they use the product and interact with the company. I am actively and eagerly involved in the design of systems and processes, from initial concept to the ongoing maintenance and support of what's been shipped. I am able to contribute to discussions with several stakeholders in the project lifecycle, from customers to project managers, to designers and user-experience teams, etc. My ability to cross-communicate among teams helps me to produce work that truly delivers what's needed.</p>

    <p>In my personal life, I love to read books, ride my bike, play guitar (well, I'm learning), play the drums, dance, go ice skating, run, cook chili, spend quality time with my friends and my family (when that is possible), and travel to new places. I am always trying to learn more about myself and how I can improve my attitude, my habits, my knowledge, and my experience. The horizon may not always be all too clear on my journey, but I am on one nonetheless.</p>

    <p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my page. If you want to be in touch, my email is [my first name] AT [my domain dot com].</p>
