  <p>Red. Green. Refactor.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start with a failing test. A compilation error (missing file, undefined class) counts as a failure.</li>
    <li>Write just enough production code to pass the test. Even if it's a hard-coded return value.</li>
    <li>Refactor the production code relentlessly. Repeat for the test code. <strong>Do not overlook your tests when you're refactoring.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Following this workflow diligently and with discipline guarantees that you will get that programmer's rush every few minutes.</p>
